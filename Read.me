# Random-Forest-Algorithm
Performed classification using Random Forest

Machine Learning is one of the most significant and amazing branches of Artificial Intelligence. It involves techniques which help a machine to learn by itself on the basis of recognized patterns thereby producing the results with less human interaction. In simple words, Machine learning involves the creation of a system which helps a machine to learn and predict automatically without being explicitly programmed. There are many algorithms which are used for making predictions in machine learning. Some of these algorithms are KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision tree, Random Forest etc. The present assignment includes the Random Forest algorithm which is performed on two different datasets.

Random Forest algorithm is a supervised machine learning algorithm widely used for predicting and analyzing the data. It is used for both the regression as well as the classification. It merges the multiple decision trees to create a forest which leads to accurate results. It is extremely simple and highly flexible to use as compared to other machine learning algorithms. Some of its applications include banking and finance sector, health care sector, e-commerce, stock market etc.  This algorithm averages several decision trees and uses straight forward hyper-parameters just like the decision tree and also avoids the major problems of machine learning i.e. over-fitting of data. However, in a real-life situation, it overfits easily, therefore proper care is to be taken while fitting the random forest. Another thing which is to be kept in mind is that it makes slow real-life predictions due to the presence of a large number of trees. Therefore, to speed up the process and to improve the model performance, boosting is used.

The present assignment contains two parts: Part A and Part B. Part A contains the glass identification dataset and Part B contains the famous wine dataset. In both the parts, the Random Forest algorithm is applied and predictions are made.
